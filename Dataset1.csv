"Bharatanatyam, is the oldest Indian classical dance form originated in the Tanjore district of tamil Nadu and regarded as the mother of many other classical dance forms of India. Bharatnatyam Dance ? Bha- Bhavam (means expression), Ra- Ragam (means music), Ta- Talam (means beat or rhythm) and Natyam (means dance) in Tamil. Bharatnatyaone of the most popular classical Indian dances. Bharatnatyam is more popular in South Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Bharatnatyam dance is almost 2,000 years old. It is believed that Bharatnatyam was revealed by Lord Brahma to Bharata, a famous sage who then codified this sacred dance in a Sanskrit text called the Natya Shastra. The Natya Shastra is one of the fundamental treatises on Indian drama and aesthetics. Natya Shastra divides dance into two distinct forms- nritta, and nritya. In nritta, focus is on mastery of abstract hand gestures and movements, whereas the dancer employs a complex system of hand signals and body language to depict emotional expressions in nritya..MusicThe music of Bharatanatyam is based on Carnatic classical music. The chief musical instruments in Bharata Natyam are the 'Mridangam' and a pair of cymbals. Sometimes Veena, Violin, Ghatam and Flute are also used.

"Kathak dance originated from Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), a state in North India. Studies suggest that Kathak originated in Varanasi and this dance form traveled through Lucknow, Jaipur, and other parts of North India and North-West India. The term Kathak is derived from the vedic sanskrit word ?Katha? which means ""story"", and 'Kathakar' which means ""the one who tells a story"". Wandering Kathakars or the traveling bards conveyed tales, inspired by our ancient epics and mythologies, through dance, songs, and music.  Kathak performers exhibit stories through graceful hand movements, extensive footwork, flexible body movements, and most importantly intense facial expressions capable of evoking a range of emotions.","Kathak dance Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) theke eshechhe, jeita North India tey.

"Kathakali is believed to have evolved in Kerala in the 17th century. Its precursor, Ramanattam, was created by the King of Kottarakkara, a region in South Kerala, to present the Ramayana (Hindu epic stories) as stylised drama pattern. There are differing historical opinions regarding the origins of Ramanattam: some suggest it was inspired by Krishnanattam, a dance drama depicting the stories of Krishna that patronised by the Samoothiri/Zamorins royal family in North Kerala. Conversely, some researchers argue that Ramanattam predates Krishnanattam. Regardless, Kathakali finds its roots in the Ramayana-based Ramanattam, which was initially performed in royal courts and later refined into the highly codified art form known as Kathakali. The further development of Kathakali is linked to the royal family of Kottayam/Vettathunadu, a region in old Malabar near present-day Kannur. The King of Kottayam, Kottayathu Thampuran, composed four major works for Kathakali: Kirmeeravadham, Bakavadham, Nivathakavacha Kalakeyavadham, and Kalyanasougandhikam. These works, based on stories from the Mahabharata (another Hindu epic) known as 'Kottayam Kathakali' on which Kathakali finds its foundation in choreography, text and performance system. In the 18th century, Kathakali was further refined by Kaplingadu Narayanan Namboothiri, an aesthete who contributed significantly to its development, which style is later renowned as Kaplingadan style of Kathakali. The art form began to flourish again in South and Central Kerala, with regional rulers, royal families, and Namboothiri families (Mana) patronising Kathakali by organising performances and establishing training centres. A pivotal figure in the 20th century- Pattikamthodi Ravunni Menon, played a crucial role in codifying Kathakali's scattered systems. Olappamanna Mana (a Namboothiri - Kerala Brahmin family) in the Village Vellinezhi played a major role in promoting Kathakali training. The style that follows a codified system in presenting both dance and dramatic aspects of kathakali that was designed by Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon and later flourished through his disciples is known as 'Kalluvazhi chitta (style)' of Kathakali. The continuous evolution of Kathakali found a complete shelter and refinement with the Kerala Kalamandalam - a prestigious institution for art and culture ","Kathakali is believed to have evolved in Kerala in the 17th century.

"Mohiniyattam grew into a codified structured form under the patronage of Maharaja Swati Thirunal- the King of Travancore (South of Kerala with the Capital at Trivandrum) in the 19th century with the help of Tamil Nattuvanars (dance teacher and composers) and dancers. The roots of present-day Mohiniyattam can be traced back to the dance tradition nurtured by King Swathi Thirunal. After his period, the dance form was popular only in central Kerala, as one of the king's court musicians and composers, Palakkad Parameshwara Bhagavathar, returned to his homeland near Palakkad in central Kerala and began training young girls. During the institutionalized training for art forms as part of Nationalist movements, Mohiniyattam received its revival at the institution Kerala Kalamandalam under the patronage of poet Vallathole Narayana Menon. Later, from the mid-twentieth century, Mohiniyattam has been accepted as one of the major art forms of Kerala.","Mohiniyattam grew into a codified structured form under the patronage of Maharaja Swati Thirunal- the King of Travancore (South of Kerala with the Capital at Trivandrum) in the 19th century with the help of Tamil Nattuvanars (dance teacher and composers) and dancers.

During the revelry, the banks of the Brahmaputra come alive with the rhythms of the dhol (drum) and pepa (flute). The dancers perform in a circle beginning with a slower tempo, which gradually gains momentum. Drums, cymbals, hornpipes, harps and bamboo clappers, provide musical accompaniment. Though the dance is inspired by agricultural operations, the songs and the graceful dancing builds up an atmosphere of love and romance. The dance has been noted for maintaining authenticity and at the same time displaying the traditional Assamese handlooms and handicrafts in their beauty and glory.

"Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art.

"The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum built by Emperor Shah Jahan for his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth in 1631. For the story behind its construction, it is axiomatic to say that it is one of the greatest monuments to love ever built. Thousands of workers laboured for over 20 years on the building, embellishing it with outstanding decorations including white marble screens and pietra dura inlay with semiprecious stones. At over 200 feet (60 meters) tall, the structure is the tallest Mughal tomb ever built and is considered to be the single greatest work of Mughal architecture. It is the centerpiece of a sprawling complex of buildings, courtyards, gardens, and waterways on the edge of the river Yamuna in Agra. Most of this original landscape is intact.

"Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a revival of the ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads. He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies there. In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest in social reforms. He also started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in 1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest against British policies in India.

"banana, fruit of the genus Musa, of the family Musaceae, one of the most important fruit crops of the world. The banana is grown in the tropics, and, though it is most widely consumed in those regions, it is valued worldwide for its flavour, nutritional value, and availability throughout the year. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas are most commonly eaten fresh, though they may be fried or mashed and chilled in pies or puddings. They may also be used to flavour muffins, cakes, or breads. Cooking varieties, or plantains, are starchy rather than sweet and are grown extensively as a staple food source in tropical regions; they are cooked when ripe or immature. A ripe fruit contains as much as 22 percent of carbohydrate and is high in dietary fibre, potassium, manganese, and vitamins B6 and C. Bananas are thought to have been first domesticated in Southeast Asia, and their consumption is mentioned in early Greek, Latin, and Arab writings; Alexander the Great saw bananas on an expedition to India. Shortly after the discovery of America, bananas were taken from the Canary Islands to the New World, where they were first established in Hispaniola and soon spread to other islands and the mainland. Cultivation increased until bananas became a staple foodstuff in many regions, and in the 19th century they began to appear in the markets of the United States.

"Penguins are flightless birds with flippers instead of wings. Their bodies are adapted for swimming and diving in the water, with some species able to reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Their body shape is fusiform (tapered at both ends) and streamlined, allowing them to be expert swimmers. They have a large head, short neck, and elongated body. Their tails are short, stiff, and wedge-shaped.
Their legs and webbed feet are set far back on the body, which gives penguins their upright posture on land. When snow conditions are right, they will slide on their bellies.
A penguin?s feather pattern makes it look like it?s wearing a tuxedo. Its feather pattern is a form of camouflage called countershading with a black body and a white belly. This coloring helps camouflage the bird in the water as it searches for prey.

He has been quite interested in learning about his surroundings and studying and explaining the things that are happening around him. He has conducted experiments and observations to gather information as a result of his interest. Through the decades, it has also been in charge of many people?s research endeavours around the globe. Systematizing and organising the knowledge acquired in this way was absolutely necessary for the good of humanity. Science is the name given to this knowledge. So, systematised knowledge that humans have acquired through observations and experimentation may be referred to as science. Due to its vast expansion and variety of subjects, science has been further divided into many branches. One of the most significant fields of science is chemistry. Chemistry can be summed up as the area of science that studies matter, including its properties, composition, and the changes that occur to it as a result of various activities. Several branches of chemistry have been created based on the specialised disciplines of research.","Man has been exposed to changing surroundings ever since he came into existence.

"There are different types of keyboards. They can be based on the way the keys work; for example, laptops have keys that do not move a lot, because the keyboard has to be very thin in order to fit inside the laptop. On the other hand, video game players often like keyboards with keys that move a lot, such as mechanical keyboards, so that they feel the key working. Gaming keyboards also need fast reaction times. In between these two types, an ergonomic keyboard is made to be easier for people to type for long periods of time, without hurting their hands or arms. There are also different ways the keys on a keyboard are arranged, usually to deal with different regions and languages of the world. Most computer keyboards have the keys in six rows, but some laptops use only five or even four rows to save space. The most popular layout is called QWERTY, which is based on the first six letters on them. The QWERTY design was made so that the most common letters would not make the moving parts of a mechanical typewriter ""jam"", or stop working. Now, even though most people do not use typewriters anymore, the design stayed because people were used to it. Other layouts have been developed, for example the Dvorak keyboard, which puts the most common letters in the places that are easiest to reach.","There are different types of keyboards.
