"Graph neural networks (GNN) are specialized artificial neural networks that are designed for tasks whose inputs are graphs.

One prominent example is molecular drug design.Each input sample is a graph representation of a molecule, where atoms form the nodes and chemical bonds between atoms form the edges. In addition to the graph representation, the input also includes known chemical properties for each of the atoms.

The key design element of GNNs is the use of pairwise message passing, such that graph nodes iteratively update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors. Several GNN architectures have been proposed, which implement different flavors of message passing,started by recursive or convolutional constructive approaches. As of 2022, it is an open question whether it is possible to define GNN architectures ""going beyond"" message passing, or instead every GNN can be built on message passing over suitably defined graphs.","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks tailored for graph-structured data.

The response was non escalatory, precise and targeted terrorist training camps at nine different locations within Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.  No military targets were engaged.  However, in the early hours of 8 May, Pakistan, in an escalated response launched coordinated drone and missile strikes targeting over a dozen Indian military installations across the Northern and Western theatres, including Srinagar, Jammu, Pathankot, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Bathinda and Bhuj. India?s robust Integrated Counter-drone Grid and layered Air Defence systems intercepted these attacks, recovering debris conclusively traced to Pakistani origin.
Following these provocations, India conducted precision strikes against Pakistani Air Defence systems at a number of locations in Pakistan.   These strikes were deliberately confined to the neutralization of systems that had facilitated the earlier Pakistani assault and were executed under the guiding principle of ?equal intensity in the same domain.? By targeting only those installations directly involved in the aggression, India balanced the imperative of deterrence with its overarching commitment to de-escalation. Concurrently, along the Line of Control in Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan escalated to unprovoked mortar and heavy-calibre artillery fire into civilian areas in which sixteen innocent lives were lost, including three women and five children.  Here too, India was compelled to respond in equal proportion with mortar and artillery fire.

"Traffic flow models are used to describe and predict the dynamic behavior of traffic on road networks, including parameters such as vehicle density, speed, and flow. These models can be either macroscopic or microscopic. Hegyi et al. optimized traffic control for highway networks using the METANET macroscopic traffic flow prediction model. Macroscopic models are suitable for describing and predicting the overall behavior of large-scale traffic networks, resulting in satisfactory outcomes for highway traffic control . Stoilova et al. extended the existing ?store-and-forward? model by incorporating optimization problems that consider the probability of vehicles, thereby better capturing the stochastic nature of actual traffic flow . Ferrara et al. used an MPC method based on the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) to manage traffic flow by controlling the inflow at ramp entrances. CTM provides a macroscopic description of traffic flow by dividing the highway into multiple cells, which helps simplify the dynamics of complex traffic flows. Sirmatel et al. proposed an MPC method based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) for network-level traffic control. The MFD typically features low dispersion and a unimodal characteristic, meaning that flow variations are relatively smooth across different accumulation levels, aiding the controller in achieving smoother and more predictable control outcomes . Wang et al.?s research on the motion state estimation of intelligent vehicles contributes not only to traffic data collection but also to the study of micro-level vehicle behaviors. Moreover, with the development of artificial intelligence technologies such as neural networks, data-driven traffic flow prediction methods have been widely applied.

This method remains effective even when extending the prediction time horizon.

Hu et al. noted that the spatial dependencies of traffic data arise from different environments and change over time; fully capturing these spatial and temporal dependencies is key to accurate predictions . In traffic networks, different road segments influence each other, and GCNs can effectively utilize these spatial relationships to improve prediction accuracy. The application of GCNs in traffic flow prediction has gained increasing attention from researchers. Compared to other traffic flow models, their superior predictive performance is mainly due to their ability to effectively represent traffic flow characteristics on urban roads in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Enhancing the representation accuracy of correlations between traffic flows using graphs is crucial for improving the predictive performance of GCNs, and this is our focus. Typically, the relationships between nodes in a road network can be represented by adjacency matrices or weight matrices. Adjacency matrices use 0 s and 1 s to indicate whether there is a connection between nodes, while weight matrices pre-set the closeness of connections between different road positions using metrics such as distance between nodes. These methods can simply describe the connections between nodes but cannot dynamically change over time, leaving room for optimization in terms of final prediction performance.","Traffic flow models, both macroscopic and microscopic, are vital for understanding and predicting traffic behavior. Macroscopic models like METANET and CTM have been successfully applied to highway traffic control. Extensions of these models incorporate stochastic elements for better accuracy. More recently, AI, particularly neural networks and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), have gained prominence for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies in road networks. While GCNs show superior performance, accurately representing the dynamic relationships between road segments using graphs remains a key area for further research and improvement.",,,,,,

A DNN can be trained on hundreds of thousands of chemical structures to encode and decode molecules, as well as building predictors that estimate chemical properties from the  latent representation. For example, we can learn an autoencoder to encode the graph representation of a molecular and then reconstruct the molecular with a decoder. The training objective is to learn a latent representation that minimizes the reconstruction loss. These latent representations allow researchers to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space by perturbing known chemical structures or interpolating between molecules. We can also use this latent representation to predict synthetic accessibility and drug similarity with another DNN (the green network below).","AI is being used to improve medical diagnosis by leveraging medical knowledge graphs and patient data for predictions, and this can be enhanced with patient history. AI also holds promise in accelerating drug discovery and biomarker identification by learning molecular representations that allow for the generation of new drug candidates and property predictions.",,,,,,
"To embed, per the English dictionary, means to fix something in a substance or solid object. With graphs, it would mean to map the whole graph in N-dimensional space.

In this example, it is also easy to spot clusters just from the graph layout, but imagine the graph having 1000 nodes - things aren't as straightforward anymore.

Furthermore, for a computer, it is easier to work with node embeddings (vectors of numbers), because it is easier to calculate how similar (close in space) 2 nodes are from embeddings in N-dimensional space than it would be to calculate from a graph only. On the other hand, there is no proper way how we could calculate the closeness of two nodes just from the graph. You could use something like the shortest path algorithm, but that itself is not representative enough. With vectors, it's easier. The most often used metric is called cosine similarity.","Graph embedding is like fixing a graph into a multi-dimensional space, where each node becomes a point represented by a vector of numbers. This process makes it easier to identify clusters or communities within the graph, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes, as humans can more readily see patterns in a lower-dimensional space. Moreover, these numerical representations (node embeddings) simplify computations for computers, particularly when determining the similarity between nodes using metrics like cosine similarity. Unlike relying solely on the graph structure, which lacks a direct measure of node closeness (and where methods like shortest path algorithms can be insufficient), embeddings provide a more efficient and representative way to assess relationships between nodes.",,,,,,

When it comes to businesses, AI-powered cybersecurity tools also can gather data from a company's own communications networks, digital activity, transactional systems, and websites, as well as other external public sources. These tools then run algorithms to identify patterns and detect or predict threatening activity, potential data breaches, etc. This is a trend we can expect to continuously see in the future as criminals constantly create new malware and data acquisition methods.","The latest tech trend involves intelligent automation (IPA), which combines Robotic.Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate end-to-end business processes, boosting productivity and efficiency.

The usual way to build a career in robotics is to complete an undergraduate degree in one of these established subjects, followed by a graduate (masters') degree in Robotics. Graduate degrees are typically joined by students coming from all of the contributing disciplines, and include familiarization of relevant undergraduate level subject matter from each of them, followed by specialist study in pure robotics topics which build upon them. As an interdisciplinary subject, robotics graduate programmes tend to be especially reliant on students working and learning together and sharing their knowledge and skills from their home discipline first degrees.

Robotics industry careers then follow the same pattern, with most roboticists working as part of interdisciplinary teams of specialists from these home disciplines followed by the robotics graduate degrees which enable them to work together. Workers typically continue to identify as members of their home disciplines who work in robotics, rather than as 'roboticists'. This structure is reinforced by the nature of some engineering professions, which grant chartered engineer status to members of home disciplines rather than to robotics as a whole.

Robotics careers are widely predicted to grow in the 21st century, as robots replace more manual and intellectual human work. Some workers who lose their jobs to robotics may be well-placed to retrain to build and maintain these robots, using their domain-specific knowledge and skills.

Robotics industry careers mirror this structure, with professionals working in interdisciplinary teams while often maintaining their primary disciplinary identities. Despite the anticipated growth in robotics careers due to automation, professionals often identify with their core engineering discipline rather than solely as ""roboticists,"" a structure reinforced by professional engineering certifications.

"In temperate regions, it is a popular houseplant with numerous cultivars selected for leaves with white, yellow, or light green variegation. It is often used in decorative displays in shopping centers, offices, and other public locations largely because it requires little care and is also attractively leafy. In tropical countries, it is found in many parks and gardens, and tends to grow naturally.

As an indoor plant it can reach more than 2 metres (2 yd) in height if given the adequate support (a trellis or moss pole to climb), but hardly develops adult-sized leaves. The best results are achieved by providing indirect light; it tolerates an intense luminosity, but long periods of direct sunlight burn the leaves. It lives well with a temperature between 17 and 30 ? (63 and 86 ?). Generally, the plant will only need watering when the soil feels dry to the touch (typically once every one to two weeks). The plant should be fertilized every 2-3 months during its growing season, and at a reduced rate the rest of the year. It should be replanted at least every 1-2 years, or sooner if it becomes too root-bound.[11] However, it is a very robust plant, and will survive bad growing conditions. The plant grows rapidly in hydroponic culture.[12]

Two modern dancers
Two common types of group dance are theatrical and participatory dance. Both types of dance may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred or liturgical. Dance is not solely restricted to performance, as dance is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities.

Gardening varies in scale from the 800 hectare Versailles gardens[3] down to container gardens grown inside. Gardens take many forms, some only contain one type of plant while others involve a complex assortment of plants with no particular order.

Gardening can be difficult to differentiate from farming. They are most easily differentiated based on their primary objectives. Farming prioritizes saleable goods and may include livestock production whereas gardening often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure. As it pertains to food production, gardening generally happens on a much smaller scale with the intent of personal or community consumption.[4] There are cultures which do not differentiate between farming and gardening.[5] This is primarily because subsistence agriculture has been the main method of farming throughout its 12,000 year history and is virtually indistinguishable from gardening.[6][7]","Gardening involves cultivating plants for various purposes like food, beauty, and other uses within a specific area, offering therapeutic and other benefits. It ranges in size from vast estates to small containers and can feature single or diverse plant arrangements.

Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).

Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid alone, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property long used to refine gold and confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term 'acid test'. Gold dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. Gold also dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute, this is not a chemical reaction.

A relatively rare element,[10][11] gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other works of art throughout recorded history. In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy. Gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after the Nixon shock measures of 1971.","Gold, a rare and precious metal, is found naturally as nuggets or grains in various geological formations and sometimes alloyed with other metals or within minerals. While resistant to most acids, it dissolves in aqua regia and cyanide solutions, properties utilized in refining and mining. Historically used for coinage, jewelry, and art, gold was once the basis of monetary policy until the gold standard was abandoned in the 20th century.",,,,,,

"Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another. These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream. Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow. Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ?0 ? (-40 ? to 104 ?) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.[8]","Different data structures excel in different applications; for instance, B-trees are common in databases for data retrieval, and hash tables are typical in compilers for identifier lookup.

A rotating cog wheel was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin. Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back.

The former, Oryctolagus, includes the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, which is the ancestor of the hundreds of breeds of domestic rabbit and has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica. The latter, Sylvilagus, includes over 13 wild rabbit species, among them the cottontails and tapetis. Wild rabbits not included in Oryctolagus and Sylvilagus include several species of limited distribution, including the pygmy rabbit, volcano rabbit, and Sumatran striped rabbit.  Rabbits are a paraphyletic grouping, and do not constitute a clade, as hares (belonging to the genus Lepus) are nested within the Leporidae clade and are not described as rabbits. Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs diverged earlier and have a number of traits rodents lack, including two extra incisors. Similarities between rabbits and rodents were once attributed to convergent evolution, but studies in molecular biology have found a common ancestor between lagomorphs and rodents and place them in the clade Glires. ","Rabbits are small herbivorous mammals belonging to the family Leporidae (which also includes hares) and the order Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). They are globally recognized as prey animals, domesticated livestock, and pets, significantly impacting ecosystems and cultures. The most common rabbit genera are Oryctolagus (including the European rabbit, ancestor to domestic breeds) and Sylvilagus (containing over 13 wild species like cottontails). Other wild rabbit species with limited distribution exist. Biologically, rabbits are a paraphyletic group, with hares being nested within the Leporidae. Despite past classification as rodents, lagomorphs evolved earlier and possess unique features like extra incisors.

Advances in Newtonian mechanics were then used to explore variations from the simple assumptions behind Kepler orbits, such as the perturbations due to other bodies, or the impact of spheroidal rather than spherical bodies. Joseph-Louis Lagrange developed a new approach to Newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than force, and made progress on the three-body problem, discovering the Lagrangian points. In a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics, in 1846 Urbain Le Verrier was able to predict the position of Neptune based on unexplained perturbations in the orbit of Uranus.","Newton showed gravity explains Kepler's laws and orbits are conic sections.

It may be darker under unusual circumstances like a solar eclipse or very high levels of atmospheric particulates, which include smoke (see New England's Dark Day), dust,[1] and volcanic ash.[2]","Daylight occurs when the Sun is above the local horizon, affecting slightly over half the Earth at any moment due to atmospheric refraction bending sunlight. Outdoor light levels range dramatically from intense noon sunlight (120,000 lux), potentially causing eye discomfort, to very dim light under thick storm clouds at sunset (less than 5 lux, sometimes even under 1 lux), where distant streetlights might cast visible shadows. Unusual events like solar eclipses or high concentrations of atmospheric particles (smoke, dust, volcanic ash) can further reduce daylight.",,,,,,

"In humans, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14?16 billion neurons,[1] and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55?70 billion.[2] Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons, typically communicating with one another via cytoplasmic processes known as dendrites and axons. Axons are usually myelinated and carry trains of rapid micro-electric signal pulses called action potentials to target specific recipient cells in other areas of the brain or distant parts of the body. The prefrontal cortex, which controls executive functions, is particularly well developed in humans.

Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs. They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.","The human brain has billions of neurons in the cortex and cerebellum, connected by synapses that use electrical signals (action potentials) for communication.

"A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material largely comprising hydrogen, helium, and trace heavier elements. Its total mass mainly determines its evolution and eventual fate. A star shines for most of its active life due to the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space.

Stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than lithium. Stellar mass loss or supernova explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. These elements are then recycled into new stars. Astronomers can determine stellar properties?including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space?by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time.","A star is born from the gravitational collapse of a nebula, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its mass dictates its life cycle and ultimate fate. For most of its existence, a star shines through the fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy. When fusion ends, the core becomes a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole, depending on the star's initial mass.

"The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.[47] Viewed from a vantage point above its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise around its axis of spin.[d][48]

A survey of solar analogues suggests the early Sun was rotating up to ten times faster than it does today. This would have made the surface much more active, with greater X-ray and UV emission. Sunspots would have covered 5?30% of the surface.[49] The rotation rate was gradually slowed by magnetic braking, as the Sun's magnetic field interacted with the outflowing solar wind.[50] A vestige of this rapid primordial rotation still survives at the Sun's core, which rotates at a rate of once per week; four times the mean surface rotation rate.[51][52]","The Sun spins faster at its equator (about 25.6 days) than at its poles (about 33.5 days), a phenomenon called differential rotation. This is caused by heat-driven convection and the Coriolis force. From Earth, the Sun's equatorial rotation appears to be about 28 days. Looking down from its north pole, the Sun rotates counterclockwise. The early Sun likely rotated up to ten times faster, leading to much higher surface activity. Its rotation has slowed down over time due to magnetic braking from the solar wind. Interestingly, the Sun's core still rotates much faster than its surface, completing a rotation in about a week.

Though the Gita praises the benefits of yoga[12][13] in releasing man's inner essence from the bounds of desire and the wheel of rebirth,[6] the text propagates the Brahmanic idea of living according to one's duty or dharma, in contrast to the ascetic ideal of seeking liberation by avoiding all karma.[12] Facing the perils of war, Arjuna hesitates to perform his duty (dharma) as a warrior. Krishna persuades him to commence in battle, arguing that while following one's dharma, one should not consider oneself to be the agent of action, but attribute all of one's actions to God (bhakti).[14][15]","The Bhagavad Gita, while traditionally credited to Veda Vyasa, is considered by historians to be a work by multiple authors, drawing from the Upanishads and Samkhya yoga.

This model requires the universe to contain large amounts of dark matter and dark energy whose nature is currently not well understood, but the model gives detailed predictions that are in excellent agreement with many diverse observations.[3]

Cosmology draws heavily on the work of many disparate areas of research in theoretical and applied physics. Areas relevant to cosmology include particle physics experiments and theory, theoretical and observational astrophysics, general relativity, quantum mechanics, and plasma physics.","Recent progress in observational cosmology, using the cosmic microwave background, distant supernovae, and galaxy redshift surveys, has led to a standard cosmological model. This model posits significant amounts of poorly understood dark matter and dark energy but provides accurate predictions consistent with various observations. Cosmology relies on diverse fields within theoretical and applied physics, including particle physics, astrophysics, general relativity, quantum mechanics, and plasma physics.",,,,,,
